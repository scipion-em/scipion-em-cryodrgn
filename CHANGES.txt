    - refactor train_vae protocol, remove analysis step and add ctf/poses parse step, add continue option
    - refactor abinitio protocol, add output volume for homogeneous reconstruction
    - new analysis protocol with a viewer
3.11: fix pointer to particles (with @pconesa)
3.10:
    - v2.3.0 added
3.9.1:
    - use max-threads=1 for train_vae until it's fixed: https://github.com/zhonge/cryodrgn/issues/245
3.9:
    - add cryoDRGN2 protocol for ab initio reconstruction
    - fix chimera viewer
3.8: fixing a bug related to zvalues and particle IDs: when the particle set is created from a subset and the ids of the set are not consecutive, cryodrgn fails
3.7:
    - drop support for v<1.0.0
    - remove emtable requirement
    - update citations
    - update the installer
    - updated viewer, removed iter selection since it is done in the protocol
    - training protocol now generates output particles and volumes (with _cryodrgnZValues column)
3.6.1: fix error when no downsampling was done, preprocess step cannot be skipped

    - Update to use version 0.3.2, deprecated versions < 0.3.0
    - protocol preprocess
    - Allow to specify chunk of particle stacks
    - Generate output CryoDrgnParticles
    - protocol training
    - Use import particles from preprocess
    - Run basic analysis as another step
